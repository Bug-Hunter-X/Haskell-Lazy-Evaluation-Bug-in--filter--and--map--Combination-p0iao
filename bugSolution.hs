```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers

-- Corrected function
myFunction :: [Int] -> [Int]
myFunction xs = filter even $ map (+1) xs

main2 :: IO ()
main2 = do
  let result = myFunction [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  print result

-- Alternatively, using list comprehension for clarity:
myFunction' :: [Int] -> [Int]
myFunction' xs = [x | x <- map (+1) xs, even x]
```
